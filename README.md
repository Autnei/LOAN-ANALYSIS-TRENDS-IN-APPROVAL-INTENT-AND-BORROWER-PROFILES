**KEY INSIGHTS**

The 21–30 age group accounts for the highest total loan amount, with requests totaling $326 million.

Education loans lead with 9.2K requests, followed by medical loans (8.5K) and venture loans (7.8K).

Borrowers with a Bachelor’s degree account for the highest total loan amount at $128M, followed by Associate degrees ($116M) and High School graduates ($114M).

Mortgage holders have the highest average credit score (633.04), compared to renters (632.36) and others (627.80).

Personal loans total $63M, but approvals for this category are lower compared to other intents like education and venture loans.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

This age group drives the majority of loan applications and disbursements. Design targeted marketing campaigns, particularly for Education loans, to better meet their needs.

Expand the education and medical loan categories with competitive terms and emphasize marketing campaigns targeting students and healthcare expenses.

Consider promoting loan products tailored to advanced degree holders who currently represent a smaller loan amount share but likely have high earning potential.

Introduce premium loan products for mortgage holders, such as low-interest rates or increased borrowing limits, capitalizing on their higher credit reliability.

Reevaluate personal loan eligibility criteria and consider offering micro-loans or flexible repayment plans to increase approvals while managing risks.
